- holds users list
- holds roles
  - DEV developer

## Task Tracker
* Task is identified by unique ID

Tracker:
- creates new tasks
- holds tasks
- (ALL) allows to mark task as completed 
- (MNG+ADM) allows to reassign tasks

When task is being created, 
- retrieve active users list from UM (sync), select random user
- fill task details
- assign task to selected user

When task is created,
- generate event TASK_CREATED (id, created_date, created_by, description, assigned_date, assigned_to)
- send event async (...to accounting)

When task is marked as completed,
- generate event TASK_COMPLETED (id, completed_date)
- send async (to accounting)

When command to reassign tasks happens,
- retrieve active users from UM (sync)
- for every active task, select random user from list
- generate event REASSIGN_TASKS ([id, assigned_date, assigned_to],[])

## Accounting
- holds users representation
  - current user balance
- holds task representation
  - ASSIGN_COST
  - COMPLETE_COST
- implements transaction log
- implements payments log
- generates daily balance

After receiving TASK_CREATE,
- generate task costs (ASSIGN_COST and COMPLETE_COST)
- create task representation in accounting (accounting attributes)
- save to transactions log
- deduct ASSIGN_COST from user

After receiving TASK_COMPLETE,
- save to transactions logs
- add COMPLETE_COST to user

After receiving REASSIGN_TASKS
- save to transaction logs
- deduct ASSIGN_COST from new user_id

When command to finish the day happens,
- if user balance is positive, generate daily payments, save to log, clear current balance
- if user balance is negative, save to log, keep negative balance
